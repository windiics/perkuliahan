 <p><em>Hello Guys!</em>&#128075 Nama Saya <strong><span style="color:#ff006e">Windi Centia Septiani&#x1F496</span></strong> dengan NIM 21030042 dari prodi Komputerisasi Akuntansi Perbankan D3&#128187</p>

         <p>
             When the beginning of the learning period in class X SMK, I got a question that actually I often hear and often I answer, but never thought about it further. The question is: <strong><em>"What do you want to be?"</em></strong>. Simple question, but still makes me think many times to answer it.
         </p>
         <p> 
             I remember, that question often came out since I was a child.
             In the past, I answered it originally. Today I answer that I want to be a Doctor, tomorrow I answer I want to be a Stewardess, the next day I answer I want to be a Designer, the next day I answer I want to be an Artist, and so on. The difference with now, I answer it with more caution. Because, determining my goals is one way to find my true identity.
         </p>
         <p>
             I want to be a writer. Why? Because it is related to me who likes to write. Writing has become a necessity for me. By writing, our brain is not too fulfilled with many thoughts, because it has been poured through writing. Besides that, I also like reading, especially if the reading is a novel.
         </p>
